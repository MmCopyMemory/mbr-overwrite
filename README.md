# Custom MBR Overwrite!
Overwrites MBR with own ASM file!<br>
Made in c++ :P<br>
- Added kernelmode version!<br>
<br>
I updated this code<br>
As said before it uses GetProcAddress and uses MT instead of MT-DLL AND I also tried reconverting values! Got this as a tip but not sure if it worked at all!<br>
Detections of course went down aswell!<br>
- usermode > 5/75 <br>
- kernelmode > 3/75 <br>
Of course detection COULD change at anytime because as we all know virustotal loves distributing stuff :)
